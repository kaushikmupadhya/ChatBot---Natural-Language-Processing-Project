# ChatBot - Natural Language Processing Project.

Our present work aims to provide a dialogue-generation chatbot by using effective deep learning architecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP). This chatbot uses movie dialogue datasets to train and then it generates dialogues based on movie conversation

- Dataset name: Cornell Movie--Dialogs Corpus
- Dataset Link: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html

- The code is given in the file Chatbot.ipynb and Chatbot.py
